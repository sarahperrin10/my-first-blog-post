### Art Piece 1
![Sarah Perrin](images/Picture1.png?raw=true "Sarah Perrin")
This piece by artist Alexandra Gorczynski was commissioned by Extra Extra Creative in 2015 and is displayed in a lounge at Miami International Airport. It is composed of multiple moving images, in addition to most striking aspect of the work: an ancient statue of a Greek goddess. I was drawn to this piece because of the intentionality with which the artist collages old and new forms of art. It is both gorgeous and highly complex. Overall, the majority of her art utilizes such statues and figureheads, as the one below, illustrating how Gorczynski is situating her own work in the richness of art history. In all, I readily enjoyed how she updated an old piece using her own style and flair in this work to bring it new meaning.
