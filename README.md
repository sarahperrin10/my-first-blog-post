This is a work completed by Scott Snibbe in 1998 called “Boundary Functions.” It is an interactive piece in which a set of lines is projected overhead onto the floor. When one person is on the floor, nothing occurs. But when two or more are on it, a set of lines begins to divide them. The purpose of the piece is to visually depict the relationships between individuals and the spaces between them. I was drawn to this piece because of the interactive nature of it, especially because so many virtual realities and pieces can be isolating. Rather, it is the technology that brings people together, rather than separating us, in that it shows those that interact with it these connections that are otherwise invisible.

This is a work called “The Art of Dying” by Dream Logic, which was completed in October 2016 and was collaborated on by over two-dozen artists. Each artist was asked to imagine his or her own vision of mortality through virtual and augmented reality. The show had about 600 participants over three nights. I was drawn to this piece because of the collaborative nature of it, and how participants were able to choose their own experience, in a sense, and also get different takes on the same topic.
